The two visualizations illustrate the core concept of framing effects, which defines as  the interpretation of graphics based on how an issue is presented. The left visualization, from a Democratic viewpoint, emphasizes a two point drop in unemployment from its peak. Conversely, the right, representing Republicans, highlights over eight percent unemployment for 43 months. Despite objectively presented data, bias arises in interpretation, revealing how framing shapes perception.The visual design of the red reference line of 8% unemployment rate leads audience focus on the above the dashed line. The blue downward trend line shows the decrease of the unemployment rate showing the drop since the recent peak.
